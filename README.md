        */ Chat Bot \*

--> nltk's framework will not work if you will directly try to access it because it not available in India.

--> I created this project in mac and I used the vpn named as AtlasVPN, it available for free at the Apple's App Store, download and turn it on and then       run the code.

--> How to RUN the project
1) First in a directory/folder put all the files ending with '.py' and '.json'.
2) Turn on the VPN.
3) Run 'train.py'.
4) Run 'app.py'.
5) Have fun with the bot.

--> You can add more data for the bot by editing the 'intents.json' file.
